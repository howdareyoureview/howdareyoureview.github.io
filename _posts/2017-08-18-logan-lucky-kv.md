*Logan Lucky*, staring Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, and others is a great action/comedy heist film that keeps you interested throughout the whole ordeal. I thought it was a solid film with a fantastic cast. Some parts were slow but you never felt too bored as the plot moved quickly.

Likes:
I really enjoyed this cast. Tatum plays a surprisingly convincing redneck character and Driver’s southern drawl was believable as well. A clear winner was Daniel Craig, who had one of the best scenes in the movie, where he casually explained the science behind his bomb, DURING the heist. Just hysterical. 
"We are dealing with science here" *holds up gummy bear bag* 
Daniel Craig. Worth mentioning again. I totally believed he was this Southern Bomb Enthusiast. Sooooo different from his Bond films. Glad to see him smile. 
The movie didn't take itself too seriously. Case in point: the whole bear scene where a guy in a bear suit slowly dissolves into the wilderness and it's never explored again. 
"Are you at a secure location?" "Well.. we're at Lowes"
"So what do you think?"  " YEAH "   ".... Alright we're in"

Dislikes:
Sometimes the dialogue was a bit dry, but a times made it seem more realistic.
Didn't realize the Logan sister was his sister until a bit into the movie. It wasn't super clear but I think I may have missed a key dialogue line. Not a knock on the film, just me not paying attention
Whole FBI plot at the end is just for a sequel, I'm assuming. Felt shoehorned but interested in how they can do another movie. Either way, I'm excited to see what may happen in LL2: Electric Boogaloo


Other thoughts:
I liked this movie a lot more than Baby Driver. I feel like the tone here was more consistent. BD seemed to really teeter the line of being a heist movie, a romcom, and an action movie. I felt more for LL’s characters as we got to understand their plight and motivations. BD just sorta thrust us into a situation where it was hard to feel for any of the cast. 
I liked how empty it felt when the heist was over. As an audience, we felt the 'what now' the characters in the film were feeling.  
The Game of Thrones bit was hysterical. Very topical, and was probably a letter straight to their writers
Totally didn't recognize Seth McFarlane.
