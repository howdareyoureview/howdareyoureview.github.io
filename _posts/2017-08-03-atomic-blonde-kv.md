*Atomic Blonde* is like 80% John Wick and like 20% Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with sprinkles of Baby Driver. Staring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy, this stylish movie was jam packed with great fight scenes and a surprising amount of eye candy üòÅ.
Theron plays Lorraine, a cold, top-level M-16 agent who attempts to find a secret microfilm dubbed 'the List,' containing he identities of all of M-16's double agents.  She meets up with Percival, a gruff station chief in Berlin right before Wall's collapse.
Pros:
The action was SUPERB. The takes were long, showing all the great choreography. The scenes were realistic and you could feel every hit Lorraine took. It was a fantastic depiction of how someone small could kick ass.
I'm a huge fan of the 80's motif and they did not hold back. My German buddy Matthias even says they really captured the Berlin feel, as some of the stuff like phone-booths was familiar to him.
The sequence of events was a bit crowded and things got confusing at times.
People's intentions were never clear until the end, so it was hard to find someone to root for, other than the obvious main character. At first I thought some motivation was the recently deceased M-16 agent she had an affair with, but that goes out the window as she has sexual relations with a French agent Delphine.

Other Thoughts:
It was interesting to see James McAvoy play these kinds of roles. I've seen him go crazy in Split as well, and it's a great contrast to his portrayal of Professor Xavier
Stilettos are very capable weapons...
Apparently the German was spot on for the most part! Just pointing this out since some movies don't go the whole mile
