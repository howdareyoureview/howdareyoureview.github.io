I feel that Star Wars Episode 8 is really two movies, taking place side by side, and intersecting at the end. The connections between the two are at times scarce and frustrating - but still incredibly fun, and thought provoking. The first movie is Luke Skywalker's tutelage of Rey in the ways of the Jedi. It takes place on a remote island and delves deep into what it means to be a Jedi, and the importance of balance in the universe. Rey and Luke are both impossibly moody throughout which of coarse makes their chemistry fun to watch. The second film takes place in the background and follows the fast dwindling rebels fight for survival against the first order. Fans of explosions, battle scenes, tactical strategy, and light sabers will have plenty to fawn over in this movie.

It's a story and a dynamic we've seen hundreds of times before but what made this installment unique is it's fixation with traditionalism - and what it means to let go of the past. Luke, the Rebel commander, and with Star Wars fans I've talked to since the films release have all been grappling with this side by side. While these first two films (episode 7 and 8) both borrow heavily from the original trilogy - it's painfully clear that the finale will deliver something bold and "off-script". With emperor Snoke, and Luke both possibly out of the picture (I realize director Rian Johnson is proclaimed by some to be the master of mind games) the final installment in this trilogy will give the newcomers (Rey, and Kai Lauren) some added focus and explore their connection in detail.

I absolutely loved the scenes connecting Kai Lauren and Rey's inner monologue/consciousness. As a die hard Harry Potter fan it reminded me of the connection explored between Harry Potter and Voldemort that examined the boundaries of greatness in the wizarding world. These sequences are a really interesting way to ask the question to what extent is insanity a prerequisite for greatness? Whether of not either Kai or Rey is truely great remains to be seen - but The Last Jedi does a really good job of showing each character struggling with doubt as to their purpose, and questioning their teachers as well as their enemies.

The Good: The Last Jedi is, like its predecessor really pretty - and skillfully shot. Visually theres a good mix of shots and sets that took artistic liberties (like the gorgeous shots of the speeders approaching the first order emitting red smoke) and more traditional scenery that feels consistent with the Star Wars universe. The puffin creatures on the Irish coastal island were an especially fun addition.

The Bad: This is a movie that requires some patience, and midway through it's not abundantly clear where it's going. The storylines can occasionally feel disconnected, and some of the cues can feel cryptic. My guess is episode 9 will likely answer manny of those questions.
