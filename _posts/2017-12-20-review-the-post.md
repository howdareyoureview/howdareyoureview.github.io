The Post is a really well made exploration into an age old questions journalists face regularly: what if the truth endangers others, or the people publishing it? If anyone was wondering where Meryl Streep has been the past few years, the answer is clear: glued in front of a mirror practicing her "Kay Graham" gaze. Streep completely stole the show, and brilliantly weaves through the impassioned boys club arguing on both sides of the biggest publishing decision in the history of the Washington Post. Despite a slow start, The Post is at it's best in moments of high conflict. In exchanges between Arthur (Bradley Whitford) and Kay (Streep), we see how journalistic idealism (this idea journalists hold that newspapers should always stand for truth) is both out of touch economically, and in perfect lockstep with the deep recesses of our guts.

To me the most poignant and relevant moment in the film is when Tony (Sarah Paulson) explains to Ben (Hanks) that its "more brave" for Kay Graham to make this publishing decision than it is for any of the well intentioned men (Ben included) to risk imprisonment. I found this moment immensely satisfying for two reasons: first because I find Hanks, and particularly his character Ben Bradlee to be immensely self-righteous. Second because I think it sheds light on something really important that applies to our current political climate/ living in "Trump's America": yelling at your enemy is easy, especially when you're yelling about him to your likeminded peers. This affiliation with allies doesn't diminish the merit of the outrage - but it does dwarf the impact of a defection by someone like Graham who risks everything, including longstanding friendships.   

 The Good: The Post is thought provoking, impactful, and poignant in this political climate. Spielberg handles his subject matter with skill, and nuance - refraining from telling us what to think and instead inviting us to feel what his characters felt.

The Bad: I realize I'm the black sheep, but Hanks' performance fell very flat to me. Aside from a wig and a thick accent I thought his performance lacked the energy, and depth Meryl Streep, Bradley Whitford, and Tracy Letts brought to their characters. In addition, despite an excellent second half: I think the post takes too long to get going, and doesn't spend enough time explaining key details of the cover up to keep the audience engaged.
