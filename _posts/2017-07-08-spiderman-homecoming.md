Marvel really has the "Superhero Movie" formula down. I must admit before watching a single minute of Spiderman: Homecoming I felt a little annoyed that Spiderman was being rebooted for the third time in what feels like 10 years. That being said - I have to credit the Marvel folks: they're very good at making movies that are self-aware about how ridiculous they are (in parts) but at the same time deliver enjoyable characters, and well-timed action sequences. I'm not ready to decide which of the 3 Spiderman actors (Holland, Garfield, McGuire) I like best just yet but I will say Holland brings an interesting spastic charisma that the other two lacked. It seems as though Marvel is making this one specifically to fit cleanly into the "Avengers" universe - so after watching this movie, I have a pretty good idea what the sequels have planned for superhero fans. If Spiderman: Homecoming were a round of mini-golf it would be right on par - it's fun, enjoyable, and ultimately unextraordinary.

The Good: This Spiderman is more fun than the Toby McGuire movies, and takes itself less seriously than the Andrew Garfield flicks - it's the sort of movie you could take your extended family to and there's a little something for everyone. Donald Glover makes a cameo in this one as a somewhat shady weapons buyer which acts as a nice piece of "punctuation" midway through. A talented cast delivers really good performances across the board (Marissa Tolmei has definitely still got it).

The Bad: Marvel is almost a victim of its own success at this point. They have owned the Box Office for what seems like a decade and as a viewer, at times I felt bored during a movie that released 10 years earlier might have held my attention longer. It's difficult for superhero movies to achieve - but Homecoming lacks even the smallest traces emotional resonance needed to stick in most folks' memories.
