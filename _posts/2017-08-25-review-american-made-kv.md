I thought it was a fun, but otherwise forgettable movie. Tom Cruise plays his usual charismatic self, and director Doug Liman continues their energetic relationship from the Edge of Tomorrow. Tom can be really funny. Too bad none of the other characters were memorable.

I enjoyed the stylistic cut-scenes of him talking into the camera, as they were a nice break from what was happening on screen, along with the cartoony map graphics.

The story is hard to believe, most likely because it’s loosely based on what really happened, but things move fast so I didn’t have to dwell on what happened on screen. Like my co-hort, I felt like it glamorized him when he was kind of a dick, but hey, that’s movies for you.

I generally like these movies that delve into historical events because I get curious about what really happened. Cue googling and looking up everything about it.

**Bottom Line:**
Overall, fun, but nothing memorable. Cruise being cruise I’d give it a **69**.
