In *The Meyerowitz Stories New and Selected* Director Noah Baumbach's talent as a writer is unleashed and on display. For anyone who has endured an unpleasant thanksgiving dinner table, a laborious family vacation, or just a prickly aging parent - this movie is especially for you. Family dynamics are an ambitious subject matter because of their nuance and complexity - and oh so manny movies have tried and failed. The reason The Meyerowitz Stories works is that it's format (3 loosely connected vignettes) mirrors what it's like to exist in a dysfunctional family. Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, and Elizabeth Marvel play the three Meyerowitz children and each exemplify a different aspect of the dysfunctional dynamic and neglect. As the prickly artist father - Dennis Hoffman's performance is one for the ages - and is my favorite performance by an actor in 2017. Equal parts funny, infuriating, sweet, and zany  - Harold tiptoes the line between acting as the source of disfunction and unity for the family beautifully.

As I watched the Meyerowitz Stories and the three perspectives (each vignette focusses on a different sibling, with an additional story acting as the conclusion) I couldn't help but feel invested in each deeply as Baumbauch does an excellent job of hi lighting the strengths and shortcomings of his three main characters. The focus and attention on each sibling in the narrative also mirrored Harold's affection and regard for each of them with Jean getting the least amount of attention. While Danny jostled with Matthew for family supremacy Jean stood stoically in the background reveling in being together as a family. The occasional absurdity, and the nuance Baumbach treats each conflict with left me wondering whether I've been victim and the villain of my own family's dysfunction.

The Good: Baumbach does a masterful job at writing and direction a family dysfunction movie that takes us through a more complete emotional gamut then just frustration and anger. The Meyerowitz stories left me happy, nostalgic, heartbroken, and infuriated at different points and I felt as though I knew each of these characters by the end.  The novel-like format is a perfect one for Baumbach and felt like what I imagine 9 Stories by J.D Salinger would be if it ever made it's way onto Netflix.

The Bad: In certain moments this movie feels "busy", and Baumbach's propencity for absurdity can make his narrative a challenge to keep up with. The score is nothing extraordinary, and the Meyerowitz stories isn't a breathtakingly original visual experience. Instead the Meyerowitz stories is a champion of the mundane, infuriating experiences that make up family life.
