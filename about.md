## About

There are a lot of review sites out there: Rotten Tomatoes, MetaCritic, CineScore, that each bring something unique to the chatter about new movies, but something about them can feel stuffy at times. We wanted to create a place for regular people to read and talk about movies in an approachable way - and answer questions that normal movie critics don’t always answer.

HDYR is interested in reviewing movies in a way that reflects people’s psychological experience, and bias. Our site isn’t aggressively trying to be objective - instead we want to tell you what we think, what our biases are, and why. Wondering if this site is right for you? Here’s some guiding questions to help you figure it out:

Have you ever seen an incredible, thought-provoking film with a few friends in theatres, and afterwards you all go home without discussing your thoughts?

Do you feel outraged that “Crash” won Best Picture in 2006? Do you know someone who defends the Academy’s choice to the death?

Do you like when characters break the fourth wall, and do you think American teens should aspire to become Ferris Bueller?

HDYR is built by people who love watching movies and talking about them, and a love of cinema. We’re powered by the good people at MoviePass (an unlimited movie subscription service), and an unwavering belief the world cares deeply about our thoughts on Toy Story 2.
